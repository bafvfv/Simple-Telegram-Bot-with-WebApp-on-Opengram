# Simple Example (only for noobs)

If you want to try this shit, at first you must install [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node), [Opengram.js](https://github.com/OpengramJS/opengram), [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), [Mysql2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2), [Dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) and [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) (to quick restart after errors in development process) to your PC.

**Example**
> `npm init`
>> `npm i opengram`
>>> `npm i axios`
>>>> `npm i mysql2`
>>>>> `npm i dotenv`
>>>>>> `npm i nodemon`

Also you must install [OpenServer](https://ospanel.io/) or [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) to easy work with a MySQL database on your PC. 

So, enjoy - it's ugly but it works:)
